# Yelp Database Application
This project was done for my databases class. It was a partner project. It was split up into three pieces. The following was the distribution of work between me and my partner:

Milestone 1:

Kayla: JSON Parser

Shrunga: UI

Milestone 2:

Kayla: ER Model, database population code for business, checkin, hours, category tables, tablesizes.txt file, update statements, one trigger

Shrunga: SQL table statements, database population code for usertable, hasfriends, review tables, two triggers, UI

Milestone 3:

Kayla: Users tab, a few queries for the charts and business tabs (but not all of them for those tabs)
Shrunga: Business tab, charts

## Project Description
The goal of the project was to create an application that queried a database. The database contained Yelp data. The application displayed information about users, businesses, and reviews.
